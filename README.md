# AutoRegressionAnalysis
This is a python script that automatically updates an excel file containing test suites and test cases to indicate which of the test cases failed are due to sync issues or are actual app issues.
This script is meant to be run with a automation testing framework which runs test suites and produces an HTML fil for each test suite which gives the information on the test cases and captures a screenshot if a test case fails.
See the "Results" folder for an idea about the type of html files and the excel file that this script runs on.

Setup instructions soon to follow.
